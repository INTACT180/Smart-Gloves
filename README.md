# Smart-Gloves (in-development)

##What is Smart-Gloves
Smart Gloves will be designed to monitor and track a user’s form for a variety of
weightlifting exercises, ensuring proper execution and maximizing potential benefits while minimizing
the risk of injury. A robust inertial measurement unit mounted on a small PCB will track the movement
of each glove and transmit this data through Bluetooth LE protocols to the user’s smartphone. This data
will be processed by a companion application that will ensure proper user form, count repetitions, and
monitor repetition speed. Smart Gloves will be designed with weightlifters of all experience levels in
mind, and currently there’s nothing quite like it on the market. In addition to weightlifting applications,
it could be used by physical therapy patients to practice rehabilitative exercises outside the supervision
of their therapist.
